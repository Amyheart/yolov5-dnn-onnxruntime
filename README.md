# yolov5-onnxruntime
This example demonstrates how to perform inference using YOLOv5 in C++ with ONNX Runtime and OpenCV's API.

It's based on ultralytics YOLOv5: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.

This project supports inference of Object Detection and Instance Segmentation with onnx model(static or dynamic model).

# Runtime Environment
Onnxruntime = onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu-1.16.0 or onnxruntime-win-x64-1.16.0

Opencv = opencv-4.8.0
